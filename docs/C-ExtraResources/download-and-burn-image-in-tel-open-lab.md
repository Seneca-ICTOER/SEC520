# Download and Burn Image in TEL Open Lab

**Please be aware of these facts when using the CD/DVD burners at Seneca's computer labs:**

- **Most labs at Seneca College require students externally boot their lab machines** (i.e. from removable disk drive) in order to use the CD / DVD burner...
- On the other hand, the **TEL OPEN LAB (Rm. T2113) allows students to boot Internally in order to download CD / DVD images** onto their Desktop, and then burn them.

The **TEL OPEN LAB (Rm. T2113)** is one of the few areas at Seneca that **allows the student to burn CD/DVDs without having to boot from an external (removable) hard drive.**

- **Although useful, the Freedom Toaster is older, and may be prone to frequent break-downs. It is recommended to use the CD / DVD burners at the open Seneca computer lab.**
